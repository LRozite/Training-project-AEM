# AEM Intern Practice Procject "Bikes" 
We are a group of AEM-dev interns in Accenture. With most of our current roadmaps done and no project talks (so far), we decided to make a mock copy of an exsiting site that was (supposedly) made with AEM - [harley-davidson.com](https://www.harley-davidson.com/eu/en/index.html). It was randomly chosen from [this](https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Adobe-Experience-Manager) list. 
The goal is to put our limited knowledge to the test, and become a better at working with AEM. Also learn to use GitHub. 

### Our group consists of -
    Ivars Knets, LÄ«ga Rozite, Verners Grizbovskis;

### Some hints -
    - When you preformed changes on a page in AEM, to snyc it to the local files go to "ui.content/src/main/content/jcr_root/content/ipp-bikes" and "Import" on that, or just the whole "jcr_root" folder a bit above. And then you can push it to github.  

# Good luck, have fun!
