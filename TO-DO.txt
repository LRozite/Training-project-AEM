TO-DO:

    -- LAST TIME: 
        removed the getNextLayerList equivilent from layer1.java and layer2.java; 
        change variable name to have a "_java"; 
        was trying to break the large .html file into a modular collection of .html files;
            category-list.html worked, menu-list.html hgasent yet worked;

    --- display as a list for product categories where needed
        ++ dialog
        ++ ditect if a tab item has a list-ID specified
        -- return list item name and link
        -- display list


    --- nav -> layer-1 highlight one moving mouse to layer-2
    --- cart / search button pop-out sidebar functionality   
    --- make it resize based on screen width
    --- MOBILE VIEW
